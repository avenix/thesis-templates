# Thesis Templates

Here you will find a template to write your bachelor’s or Master’s thesis at the Technical University of Munich. You might choose between two templates:

- Latex. This is the conventional latex.
- Lyx. This is an interface on top of latex. It compiles your project using latex without you having to know the latex syntax. See: [Lyx Website](https://www.lyx.org/)
